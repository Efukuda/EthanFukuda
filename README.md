# Activity 2: ISQA 4900




We were assigned to create our own webpage, using HTML and CSS, as well as using Git and GItHub as version control for the project.

## Instructions

Your job is to create your own simple website to demonstrate your HTML and CSS skills. It can be about any topic you would like. Be sure to include at least one image.  Feel free to add JavaScript as well but it is not necessary. After learning how to use git on your PC or Mac, it is time to create your own local git repository and then push your code to your github repository.  Be sure to preview your website frequently as you are building it.
