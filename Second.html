            Ever since I was young, I have been interested in technology, the it's quick growth and its never ending possibilities,
                which has led to my eventual enrollment into this Master's program, and eventually into this class.  My main interests in
                the real world would be to become a Data Analyst, using business intelligence tools to create reports and display information or become
                an IT project manager.

                I believe this class will help me to achieve my employment goals by increasing my knowledge of web development, which is a great skill
                to learn especially if I want to become a part of the IT world.  I hope to master the basics of Python and object oriented programming
                , which are two highly coveted skills that businesses are looking for, as well as improve my web development skills and knowledge.
